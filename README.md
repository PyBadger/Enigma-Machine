Enigma machine

Intended purpose:
The program will attempt to emulate the german enigma machine used in WW2 in its function that it will encrypt and decipher messages.
The encryption will hopefully dynamic and as such, prevent any reader from being able to back-trace the logic of the encryption by analyzing multiple encrypted messages.
