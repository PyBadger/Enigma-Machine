The actual machine contained the following components:
- A keyboard that took an input
- A plugboard that acted as a first level of encryption
- At least three rotors that performed a level 3 (?) substitution encryption, the initial setting of which could
also be changed.
- A reflector, which also acts as a rotor/scrambler, but which does not move.
- A system of lamps, that showed the user the message ( letterwise ) encrypted.

As we are not bound to components, this program will not emulate every aspect of the enigma machine.
The core principles however will be copied : an input will be scrambled by a plugboard followed by three
separate scramblers. The intial settings of the plugboard (probably three letters?) and the scrambler will be 
open to be altered by the user - which is also what will allow the machine to deschiper its own encryption. For
ease, we will only use three rotors, based on the hisotrical rotors Q, E and V.

KEYBOARD:
Simply takes input letters and converts into position on the alphabet.

PLUGBOARD:
Simply takes three positions of the alphabet and replaces them according to the users' wishes. Example:
A-B, C-F, E-G.

SCRAMBLERS / ROTORS:
